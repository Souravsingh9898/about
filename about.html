    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hi, I’m <b>Sourav Singh</b>, born on 4th September 2002 in Punjab. I lived there until 2014, after which my family and I shifted to Delhi. My roots are in Bihar, my primary education was in Punjab, and I’m currently pursuing my higher studies in Delhi.</p>

    <p>I have <b>1 year and 7 months of experience</b> in Customer Support, where I built strong communication skills and the ability to handle challenges effectively. Along with that, I’ve completed an advanced Excel course and gained good knowledge of other Microsoft tools.</p>

    <p>Creativity has always been close to me — I’ve worked as an actor for a YouTube channel, once managed my own channel, and picked up skills in writing, editing, and content creation along the way.</p>

    <p>A couple of personal milestones I’m proud of: in 2023, I bought myself a gaming laptop from my own earnings, and recently I purchased a bike, both of which hold special value for me.</p>

    <p>Outside of work and studies, I’m passionate about fitness, gyming, and bike riding. I also love creating videos, not as a profession, but as something that satisfies me creatively.</p>

    <p>I enjoy spending time alone, reflecting, and exploring different experiences in life. My goal is to learn from every field I step into and grow as an individual.</p>
